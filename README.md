A WPF based word search game where user has to find as many words as they can from a long string within a specified amount of time.

<h2>How it works?</h2>
This is a game that utilizes TCP/IP connection to connect server and client. The server listents for any connection on a given port
The client connects using the IP of the machine and the port of the server. The server grabs a random file from the game file and 
parses the data. Using a custom protocol, it sends data to the client upon request.
